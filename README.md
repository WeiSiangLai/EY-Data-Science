# EY Open Science AI and Data Challenge 2025: Cooling Urban Heat Islands
This is the [competition link](https://challenge.ey.com/challenges/the-2025-ey-open-science-ai-and-data-challenge-cooling-urban-heat-islands-external-participants).
The goal of the challenge is to develop a machine learning model to predict heat island hotspots in an urban location. Additionally, the model should be designed to discern and highlight the key factors that contribute significantly to the development of these hotspots within city environments.

Participants will be given near-surface air temperature data in an index format, which was collected on 24 July 2021 using a ground traverse in the Bronx and Manhattan region of New York City. This dataset constitutes traverse points (latitude and longitude) and their corresponding UHI (Urban Heat Island) index values. Participants will use this dataset to build a regression model to predict UHI Index values for a given set of locations.
